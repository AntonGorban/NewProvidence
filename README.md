Responsive landing page designed to promote software products for IOS.

> This is my first layout, in the development of which I started using preprocessors and [`everyGULP`](https://github.com/AntonGorban/everyGULP).

## Layout

The layout is represented by a `psd` file at [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11yCPfk5fW0fWbdi8FaXGdeO16ZjNIyz3/view?usp=sharing) and a `png` file.

## Technology

layout is made using preprocessors `PUG` and `SCSS`.

Adaptive/responsive is implemented with `flexbox` and `media queries`.

The positioning of the items is done with `flexbox`.
